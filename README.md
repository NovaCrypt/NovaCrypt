**Digital Craftsman (Developer/Graphic Designer)**

I'm a solo software developer and graphic designer building my own digital presence one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
All graphical content is created the same way, from inspiration and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my Patreon page [NovaCypt][https://www.patreon.com/NovaAI].
